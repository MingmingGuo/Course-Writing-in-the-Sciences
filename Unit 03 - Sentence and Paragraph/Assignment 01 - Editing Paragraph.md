### Original paragraph:
> _As for many food components, the intake of metal ions can be a double edged sword. The requirement for ingestion of trace metals such as Fe and Cu ions to maintain normal body functions such as the synthesis of metalloproteins is well established. However, cases of excess intake of trace metal ions are credited with pathological events such as the deposition of iron oxides in Parkinson's disease [1]. In addition to aiding neurological depositions, these redox active metals ions have been credited with enhancing oxidative damage, a key component of chronic inflammatory disease [2] and a suggested initiator of cancer [3]. As inflammation is a characteristic feature of a wide range of diseases, further potential pathological roles for metal ions are emerging as exemplified by premature ageing [4]._

### Outline:
+ Metal ions consumption is a double-edged sword.
+ Metal ions with small amount maintains body functions.
+ Metal ions with large amount depose iron oxides.
+ Metal ions enhance oxidative damage, leading to inflamatory and cancer.
+ Metal ions create premature ageing.

### Edited paragraph:
> Consuming metal ions, i.e. Fe or Cu, can be a double-edged sword. Ingesting metal irons with a sufficient amount helps maintain body functions, such as the synthesis of metalloproteins. However, ingesting metal irons with excess amount deposes iron oxides in Parkinson's disease [1] and increases oxidative damage, which leads to chronic inflammatory [2], cancer [3], and premature ageing [4].
