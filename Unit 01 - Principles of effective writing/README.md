### 1. What makes a good writing:
+ Communicate an idea CLEARLY and EFFECTIVELY ***(really important)***
+ Elegant and stylist ***(no so important)***

### 2. Examples of what not to do:
+ Always ask yourself:
	+ Is this sentence easy to understand?
	+ Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?
+ **Verb moves the sentences along, whereas nouns slow them down.**

### 3. Principles of effective writing
+ ***Exemplary example***: *Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer.*
	+ Nouns instead of verbs (`Dysregulation`, `initiation`, `progression`, `expression`) ***=> slow the reader down***
	+ Vague words (`physiologic`, `molecular species`): too broad, does not bring a concrete picture of what the author is talking about. ***=> Don't add anything***
	+ Unnecessary jargon and acronyms (`miR`, `gliomagenesis`) ***=> slow the reading down*** unless they are standard terms that everybody is familiar with.
	+ Passive voice `has been shown` ***=> awkward, hard to read*** as this is not the way we talk.
	+ Distance between the subject `molecular species` and the main verb `may play` ***=> difficult to follow the sentence***  
  ***=> Changes in microRNA expression play a role in cancer, including glioma. Therefore, events that disrupt microRNAs from binding to their target RNAs may also promote cancer.***
+ **Principle of effective writing**:
	+ Cut **unnecessary** words and phrases; learn to part with your words!
	+ Use the **active voice** rather than passive voice
	+ Use the **strong verbs**
	+ **Avoid turning verbs into nouns**
	+ **Don't bury** the main verb! 

### 4. Some common clutter that needs to be cut:
+ Dead words and phrases (`As it is well known`, `as it has been shown`, `it can be regarded that`, `it should be emphasized that...`)
+ Empty words and phrases (`important`, `methodologic`, `basic tenets of....`)
+ Long words or phrases that could be shorted
+ Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
+ Repeated words or phrases (`studies/examples`, `illustrate/demonstrate`, `challenge/difficulties`, `successful solutions` - solution already success)
+ Adverbs `(very, really, quite, basically, generally, etc...)` are suitable for speaking  but weak for writing

### 5. Small tricks to cut the clutters
+ **Eliminate the negatives.**
  + You can **always** turn negative words into the positive ones, you just have to be clever
  + It's usually much cleare when using the possitive contruction
  + ***Examples***:
 	+ *I am not crazy about the movie but for its aesthetic elements.*
  		+ ***I only like the movie’s aesthetic elements.***
  	+ *I will not go to the market unless I have to.*
  		+ ***I will only go to the market if necessary.***
  	+ *She did not want to perform the experiment incorrectly.*
  		+ ***She wanted to perform the experiment correctly.*** 
  + Some few examples of elimiating negatives:  
  	| Netagive                 | Positive    |
	|--------------------------|-------------|
	| Not honest               | dishonest   |
	| Not harmful              | safe        |
	| Not important            | unimportant |
	| Does not have            | lacks       |
	| Did not remember         | forgot      |
	| Did not pay attention to | ignored     |
	| Did not succeed          | failed      |
  + There are many ways to avoid negative sentences and strengthen the writing. You can read it in [**here**](https://wordvice.com/grammar-avoid-double-negatives/).

+ **Eliminate there are/there is.**
  + Pay attention to the superfluous uses of `there are`, `there is`, `there was`,...
  + By get rid of these *"there are/there is/there was"*, we get a much more exciting verb, rather than the *"to be"* ones
  + ***Examples***:
  	+ *There are many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys.*
  		+ ***We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.*** 
  	+ *There was a long line of bacteria on the plate.*
  		+ ***Bacteria lined the plate.*** 
	+ *The data confirm that there is an association between vegetables and cancer.*
  		+ ***The data confirm an association between vegetables and cancer.***

+ **Omit needless prepositions ("that", "on",...)**
  + Often prepositions like `that` and `on` are completely unnecessary, they are superfluous
  + Makes every words count, especially in the abstract
  + You might think you need them, but you actually don't
  + ***Examples***:
 	+ *The meeting happened on Monday.*
 		+ ***The meeting happened Monday.*** 
	+ *They agreed that it was true.*
  		+ ***They agreed it was true.***

### 6. Practice cutting clutter:
+ _Anti-inflammatory drugs may be protective for the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease._
  + ***Anti-inflammatory drugs may protect against Alzheimer's Disease.***

+ _Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population._
  + ***Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of newborns.***
  
+ _Ultimately P53 guards not only against malignant transformation but also plays a role in developmental processes as diverse as aging, differentiation, and fertility._
  + ***Besides preventing cancer, P53 also plays role in aging, differentiation, and fertility.***
  
+ _Injuries to the brain and spinal cord have long been known to be among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically._
  + ***Brain and spinal cord damage are among the most devastating and expensive.***
  
+ _An IQ test measures an individual’s abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of verbal communication, reasoning, and performance on tasks that represent motor and spatial capabilities._
  + ***IQ test measures an individual's verbal, reasoning, or motor and spatial capabilities.***

+ _As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 Up, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy._
  + ***Figure 2 shows a return kinetic energy less than 3.2 Up yields two electron trajectories.***
