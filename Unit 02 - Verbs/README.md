### 1. Active voice:
+ Active voice is the natural way to talk and write
+ Passive voice is a way to avoid claiming responsibility for action
+ To turn the passive voice back to active: 
	- Ask yourself => ***"WHO does what to whom?"***
	- Be direct, into the point
+ Advantages of the active voice:
	- **Emphasizes author responsibility**:
		- Keep focus on the fact that authors, humans were involved
	- **Improves readability**:
		- More direct
	- **Reduces ambiguity**:
		- More specific
+ Just use the passive voice **"sparingly and purposefully"**: such as the method section where **what was done is** more important than who did it.

### 2. Personal pronouns ("We" or "I"):
+ Avoiding personal pronouns does not make your science more objective
+ "We" or "I" => claim responsibility for the assertion in the text
+ The goal is to be more objective (with personal pronouns), not to appear more objective (without personal pronouns).

### 3. Active voice practice:
+ _A recommendation was made by the DSMB committee that the study be halted._
	+ ***The DSMB committee recommended that the study be halted.***

+ _Major differences in the reaction times of the two study subjects were found._
	+ ***The two study subjects differed in reaction times.***

+ _It was concluded by the editors that the data had been falsified by the authors._
	+ ***The editor concluded the authors falsified their data.***

+ _The first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star has been taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope._ 
	+ ***NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has taken the first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star.***

+ _Therefore, the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performances are not different was rejected._
	+ ***Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis that... at the same level of performance are comparable.***
### 4. Write with verbs: 
+ **Verbs make sentences go!**
	+ ***Example***: _Loud music came form speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena moved as the hungry crowd got to its feed._
		+ ***Loud music exploded form speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena shook as the hungry crowd leaped to its feed.***  
		=> make the sentence so vivid, draws the reader in, brings the sentence to life
+ **Use strong verbs**
	+ Try to avoid the use of adverbs, **pick the right verb** that already has the adverb embedded in the verb.
		- ***Example***: _The WHO *reports* that *approximately* two-thirds of the world's diabetics are found in developing countries, and *estimates* that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years._
			- ***The WHO *estimates* that two-thirds of the world's diabetics are found in developing countries, and *projects* that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.***  
			=> Stronger verbs. The verb ***"project"*** embraces the idea of future
	+ Use **_"to be"_** verbs **purposefully** and **sparingly**.
		- Highly oversused in scientific writing and they're boring
		- Can't avoid it, but they should not be the predominant verbs 
		- Try to substitute those "to be" verbs with something a little bit more exciting, a little bit stronger
		- ***Examples***:
			- _He is a student who is intelligent and confident. He is always completing assignments on time._
				- ***The intelligent, confident student always completes assignments on time.*** 
			- _It was difficult to get out of bed at 6:00 a.m. each morning._
				- ***The student faced the difficulty and got out of bed at 6:00 a.m. each morning.***
			- _Bill is going to start bringing all of his books to the group session for studying._
				- ***Bill decided to bring all of his books to the group study session.***
+ **Don't turn verbs into nouns**
	- Make it more ambiguous, lack of action, slow the reader down
		- *During DNA damage, recognition of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in recruitment of Sin3/HDAC and repression of cell proliferation genes.*
			- ***During DNA damage, H3K4me2 recruits ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together repress cell proliferation genes.***
	- Common thing in academic writing: take a nice spunky verb, turn it into a boring noun, and pair it with a weak verb
		- ***Examples***:
			- `obtain estimates of` => ***`estimate`***
			- `has seen an expansion in` => ***`expand`***
			- `provides a methodologic emphasis` => ***`emphasizes methodology`***
			- `offer confirmation of` => ***`decide`***
+ **Don't bury the main verb**
	- Keep the subject and main verb close together at the start of the sentence.
		- ***Example***: *One study of XXX found that only YYY*
	  		- ***One study found that, of XXX, only YYY.***
### 5. Practice examples:
+ _The fear expressed by some teachers that students would not learn statistics well if they were permitted to use canned computer programs has not been realized in our experience. A careful monitoring of achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in the teaching of our course revealed no appreciable change in students’ performances._
	- ***Many teachers feared that the use of canned computer programs would prevent students from learning statistics well. We monitored student's achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in our courses and found no detriments in performance.***
	 
+ _Review of each center’s progress in recruitment is important to ensure that the cost involved in maintaining each center’s participation is worthwhile._ 
	- ***We should review each center's recruitment progress to make sure its continued participation is cost-effective.***
	
+ _It should be emphasized that these proportions generally are not the result of significant increases in moderate and severe injuries, but in many instances reflect mildly injured persons not being seen at a hospital._
	- ***Shifting proportions in injury severity may reflect stricter hospital admission criteria rather than true increases in moderate and severe injuries.***

+ _Important studies to examine the descriptive epidemiology of autism, including the prevalence and changes in the characteristics of the population over time, have begun._ 
	- ***Studies have begun to describe epidemiology of autism, including recent changes in the disorder's prevalence and characteristics.***

+ _There are multiple other mechanisms that are important, but most of themes are suspected to only have a small impact or are only important because of impact on one of the three primary mechanisms._
	- ***Most multiple mechanisms play only a small role or work by impacting one of the three primary mechanisms.***

+ _After rejecting paths with poor signal-to-noise ratios, we were left with 678 velocity measurements of waves with 7.5 seconds period and 891 measurements of 15-second waves._
	- ***Rejecting paths with poor signal-to-noise ratios left 678 velocity measurements of 7.5-second waves and 891 of 15-second waves.***

+ _It is suspected that the importance of temperature has more to do with impacting rates of other reactions than being a mechanism of disinfection itself since ponds are rarely hot enough for temperature alone to cause disinfection._
	- ***Ponds are rarely hot enough for temperature alone to cause disinfection; thus, the effect of temperature is likely mediated through its impact on the rates of other reactions.***

+ _It was assumed that due to reduced work at the joints of the lower limbs and less energy loss in the prosthetics leg, running with the dedicated prostheses allows for maximum sprinting at lower metabolic costs than in the healthy ankle joint complex._
	- ***The prosthetics leg reduces work and energy loss comparing with a healthy ankle joint, which may lead to lower metabolic costs during maximum sprinting.***
### 6. A few grammar tips:
+ The word `data` is plural: `Data are`, not `Data is`
+ Affect vs. effect:
	- `Affect` is the verb `to influence`
		- *The class affected her.*
	- `Effect` is the noun form of this influence
		- *The class had an effect on her.*
+ `Compared to` vs. `Compared with`
	- `Compare to` = to point out similarities between different things
	- `Compare with` = to point out differences between similar things
+ `That` vs. `which`
	- That is the restrictive (defining) pronoun
	- Which is the nonrestricted (non-defining) pronoun
	- Key question: Is your clause ***essential or not?***
		- If **essential**, cannot be eliminated => That
		- If **not essential**, can be ellimated => Which
	- ***Examples***:
		- *The vial that contained her RNA was lost.*
			- ***The RNA is essential => Identifies which vial of many.***
		- *The vial, which contained her RNA, was lost.*
			- ***The RNA is not essential. There is only one vial.***
+ Singular antencedents:
	- Do not use `they` or `their` when the subject is singular
	- To avoid gender choice, turn to a plural
	- ***Examples***:
		- *Each student worries about their grade.*
		- *Each student worries about her grade.*
			- ***All students worry about their grades.***
***
### Notes:
+ Be careful with "hedge" words (`no appreciable change`, `it is suppected that`,...). They often unnecessary and raise all sorts of questions.
+ Wise word: ***`"Careful writers, watchful for small conveniences, go which-hunting, remove the defining whiches, and by doing so improve their work."`*** - Strunk and White
